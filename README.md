# RocketLeague Match History Application

This application is a simple tool to help keep track of the win/loss ratio in the popular sports video game Rocket League. 
Although a number of websites exist that provide win loss ratios and other statistics, they are generally not updated in real-time. 
This application attempts to show the user how their match history in real-time so they can track their progression through ranked gameplay.

2.) Add analysis on match history to see if the user is improving.
